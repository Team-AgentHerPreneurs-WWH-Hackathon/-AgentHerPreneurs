## 🌟 **Why EmpowerHer Matters**

Millions of women entrepreneurs across India face barriers to growth and independence:

- Manual and error-prone financial tracking  
- Limited awareness of government schemes and financial tools  
- Low digital literacy and fear of scams  
- No business support during crises or financial distress  
- Limited access to financial education or investment advice  

**EmpowerHer** bridges this gap through an intuitive, voice-enabled, multi-agent AI platform tailored to their needs.
